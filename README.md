# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various factors using a Linear Regression model. Accurate car price predictions can benefit sellers and buyers in making informed decisions. By analyzing factors such as mileage, year, fuel type, transmission, and engine size, this model provides insights into what influences car prices the most.

## Project Structure
This project follows standard machine learning workflow steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore the relationships between features and the target variable (price).
3. **Modeling with Linear Regression**: Train a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on input features.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics and interpret the results.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is provided in CSV format and includes the following columns:

- **model**: Car model name
- **year**: Year of manufacture
- **price**: Price of the car (target variable)
- **transmission**: Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic)
- **mileage**: Total miles driven
- **fuelType**: Fuel type (e.g., petrol, diesel)
- **tax**: Road tax in currency units
- **mpg**: Miles per gallon, indicating fuel efficiency
- **engineSize**: Engine size in liters

## Goals
- **Analyze** the data to understand relationships between car price and other features.
- **Develop** a Linear Regression model to predict car prices accurately.
- **Identify** key factors influencing car prices, providing insights for both sellers and buyers.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, encode categorical features (like transmission and fuel type), and normalize numerical features if needed.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Perform visual analysis to see trends and correlations between features (e.g., how mileage or year affects price).
3. **Modeling**: Build a Linear Regression model to predict `price` based on the dataset features.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess model performance.
